# MDD-SexSpecific-Transcriptomics-Project
MDD Sex-Specific Transcriptomics Project

This repository contains code, workflows, and documentation for analyzing sex-specific transcriptomic signatures in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

Repository Contents

notebooks/ – Google Colab notebooks used for analysis

scripts/ – R scripts for preprocessing and modeling

results/ – Figures, tables, and output files

ai_usage.md – Documentation of AI assistance

sessionInfo.txt – R environment information for reproducibility

README.md – Overview and instructions

How to Use This Repo

Open the notebooks in Google Colab.

Follow the workflow beginning with 01_data_download.ipynb.

All code needed for reproduction is included in the notebooks/scripts folders.

Figures will be generated automatically when running the analysis.

Project Goal

To model and identify sex-specific gene expression differences associated with Major Depressive Disorder using public GEO datasets.
