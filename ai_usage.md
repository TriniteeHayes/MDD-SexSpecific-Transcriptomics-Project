# AI Usage Documentation

## Overview
This project used AI assistance in a limited and transparent way to support coding, formatting, and explanation tasks. All scientific interpretations, code execution, validation, and decision-making were performed and verified manually.

## How AI Was Used
AI tools (ChatGPT) were used for:
- Debugging Python code related to loading GSE98793 and performing PCA/DE analysis
- Generating plotting code templates for volcano plots, heatmaps, and bar charts
- Improving clarity and formatting of figure captions and slide text
- Helping structure the README.md file and final presentation outline

## What AI Was *Not* Used For
- AI did **not** create the dataset  
- AI did **not** run or interpret statistical tests without manual review  
- AI did **not** write the final analysis conclusions — these were reviewed and revised by the student  
- AI did **not** automate the notebook or produce final results; all figures were generated manually from the executed notebook

## Verification
All code, outputs, and interpretations suggested by AI were:
1. **Manually checked**,  
2. **Executed independently** in the notebook, and  
3. **Confirmed to be accurate** before inclusion in the final report and presentation.

## Ethical Compliance
This documentation is included to comply with class requirements for transparency in the use of AI-assisted tools.  
The project remains the student's original work, and AI served only as a support tool, similar to a tutor or coding assistant.
